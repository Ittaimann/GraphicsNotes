# Opening discussion
- Power considerations are something that may need to be made.  
- Live service structure prioritizes fast development time and that  means things like baking may become irrelevant or just generally a harder sell.
- Min spec is not moving quickly at all. In fact it seems to be locked at around the ps4 era based on windows arm devices and qualcom gpus.
-  Upscaling and interpolation have been becoming more common, allowing for higher framerates for a wide variety of people.
- The actual hardware of the devices is becoming less important relative to our techniques as we are largely making a way around it.
- Disc space is becoming difficult to deal with as well. Higher resolution higher fidelity assets requires a lot more space in general.
- ML based upscalers are cool, but IHVs make them very locked down sometimes, black boxing them and creating issues for the devs.
- Also with ML based solutions that are trained by the IHV... what if its a live game that changes is aesthetic for some seasonal release? What happens then? the ML may just mess up.
- How does the npu work into our models? We currently use gpus for the vast amount of ml but NPU interfaces are not very well defined currently.
